# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Modern Document Management UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a suite of modern, responsive UI components for document management, including document listing, upload, and action interfaces, fully integrated with the existing design system.
# Details:
1. Update `/apps/web-client/src/app/(main)/[anno]/documenti/page.tsx` to render the new document management interface for the selected year, ensuring seamless integration with routing and state management.
2. Build a responsive Document Grid/List component with toggle functionality, displaying image previews (jpg, png, gif, webp), file type icons for non-image files, and metadata (name, size, upload date). Implement multi-select with checkboxes, search, and filter controls. Use UI patterns and components from `@repo/ui` for consistency and accessibility. Reference best-in-class document list UI/UX examples for layout and interaction inspiration[3].
3. Create a drag-and-drop Document Upload component supporting multiple files, file picker fallback, upload progress, file validation, and pre-upload previews. Integrate with server actions for upload, and provide clear feedback for errors and successes using toast notifications.
4. Implement Document Actions: single/bulk download (ZIP for multiple), single/bulk delete with confirmation modals, renaming/editing modal, and a details modal. Use established modal and button patterns from the codebase, ensuring logical button hierarchy, clear feedback, and accessibility[1].
5. Ensure all components are fully responsive, adapting layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile. Follow the existing fatturex design system for color, typography, spacing, and interaction patterns.
6. Integrate server actions via the `useServerAction` hook for all data mutations, handling loading and error states gracefully. Use toast notifications for user feedback on all actions.
7. Adhere to modern UI design patterns for clarity, usability, and consistency, referencing established resources for best practices[1][3].

# Test Strategy:
- Manually verify the Documents page displays the correct interface for the selected year and is fully responsive across devices.
- Test the Document Grid/List component for correct rendering of previews, icons, metadata, multi-select, search, and filter functionality.
- Upload various file types and sizes using drag-and-drop and file picker, confirming progress indicators, validation, and preview features work as expected.
- Perform single and bulk actions (download, delete, rename, view details), ensuring modals appear, actions complete successfully, and feedback is shown via toasts.
- Check integration with server actions for all mutations, including error and loading states.
- Use accessibility tools to verify keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, and screen reader compatibility.
- Conduct cross-browser and device testing to ensure consistent appearance and behavior.
