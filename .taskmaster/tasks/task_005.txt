# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing and Integration for Document Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and execute a robust testing strategy for the document management system, covering end-to-end, integration, performance, security, and error handling scenarios, and produce user and developer documentation.
# Details:
Set up Playwright for automated end-to-end testing, covering all critical user flows: document upload (single/multiple), viewing, preview, download (single/bulk ZIP), deletion (single/bulk), search/filtering, and responsive behavior on mobile/desktop. Simulate error conditions such as network failures and invalid file uploads. Integrate Playwright tests into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous validation. For integration testing, verify seamless operation between server actions, Vercel Blob storage, database, authentication, file validation, and UI components, ensuring metadata consistency and correct authorization. Conduct performance tests for large files, concurrent uploads, bulk operations, and UI optimizations like lazy loading. Implement security tests to confirm access controls, file validation, secure URLs, and SQL injection protection. Document all testing procedures, edge cases, and provide clear user and developer guides for the document management features. Follow established codebase patterns and leverage Playwright's advanced features for resilient, maintainable tests.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write Playwright E2E tests for all user flows, running them locally and in CI/CD to ensure cross-browser and cross-device compatibility. 2. Develop integration tests to validate interactions between server actions, storage, database, and authentication, using mocks/stubs where necessary. 3. Use large and concurrent file uploads to measure performance and identify bottlenecks. 4. Execute security tests by attempting unauthorized access, uploading invalid files, and simulating SQL injection attempts. 5. Simulate error scenarios (e.g., network failures, quota exceeded) and verify graceful handling. 6. Review and validate user and developer documentation for completeness and clarity.
