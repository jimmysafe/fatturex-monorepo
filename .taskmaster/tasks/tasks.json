This ensures that only authorized users can access the documents within the specified time frame.\n\n3. **Edge Function Implementation**: Use Next.js edge functions or similar technology to handle the proxying of blob URLs. This involves fetching the blob content and returning it as a response to the client, ensuring that the URL is only accessible with a valid token.\n\n4. **Expiration Management**: Implement logic to manage the expiration of these tokens, ensuring that they become invalid after a set period (e.g., one hour).\n\n5. **Authorization Checks**: Integrate comprehensive authorization checks to verify that users can only access their own documents, even with a valid token.

The root cause was improper extension of File objects using Object.assign, which failed due to File objects being read-only, causing upload failures and incorrect file metadata display (\"NaN undefined\").\n\nKey fixes include:\n\n- Redesigned file processing to create FileWithPreview objects by copying File properties and binding File methods instead of extending File objects.\n- Preserved original File references for accurate server upload.\n- Restructured TypeScript interfaces to avoid extending File directly, resolving type conflicts with useServerAction and uploadDocuments.\n- Maintained client-side validation, preview generation, progress tracking, and robust error handling.\n- Ensured server action receives proper File objects for successful blob storage upload.\n\nValidation confirms correct file size display, functional validation, image previews, upload progress, error handling, retry mechanisms, and successful TypeScript compilation.\n\nThis fix makes the Document Upload Component fully functional and production-ready, ensuring reliable file uploads with accurate metadata and seamless integration with backend services.\n</info added on 2025-07-03T06:37:58.609Z>",
