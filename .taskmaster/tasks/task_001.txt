# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement S3-Compatible Document Storage with Vercel Blob
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop server actions to upload, retrieve, and delete documents using Vercel Blob, organizing files under a /$userId/$anno folder structure.
# Details:
Set up Vercel Blob as the storage backend, leveraging its S3-compatible API and global distribution for reliability and performance. Implement server actions in Next.js using the App Router and ZSA patterns to handle file uploads, retrievals, and deletions. Ensure files are stored under a directory structure based on user ID and selected year (e.g., /$userId/$anno). Use the '@vercel/blob' package for integration, and configure environment variables for secure access. Implement file validation (size, type) at the server action level. Prepare for future integration with authentication and metadata storage by designing extensible APIs. Reference Vercel Blob documentation for best practices on large file handling, resumable uploads, and concurrency.

# Test Strategy:
1. Upload various file types and sizes, verifying they are stored in the correct /$userId/$anno path in Vercel Blob.
2. Retrieve uploaded files and confirm content integrity and correct access paths.
3. Delete files and ensure they are removed from storage.
4. Test error handling for invalid file types, oversized files, and unauthorized access attempts.
5. Review logs and storage dashboard to confirm correct operation and organization.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Vercel Blob Storage and Environment Variables [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Vercel Blob as the S3-compatible storage backend and set up all required environment variables for secure access.
### Details:
Follow Vercel Blob documentation to create a Blob store, generate API tokens with appropriate permissions, and add environment variables (such as access key and secret) to the project configuration.

## 2. Install and Integrate '@vercel/blob' Package [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Add the '@vercel/blob' package to the Next.js project and ensure it is properly imported for use in server actions.
### Details:
Use the package manager to install '@vercel/blob' and update imports in relevant server action files.

## 3. Design Directory Structure for File Organization [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Define and implement the /$userId/$anno folder structure for storing documents in Vercel Blob.
### Details:
Ensure all file operations (upload, retrieve, delete) use the correct path structure based on user ID and selected year.

## 4. Implement File Upload Server Action [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Develop a server action using Next.js App Router and ZSA patterns to handle file uploads, including validation for file size and type.
### Details:
Use '@vercel/blob' to upload files, validate file properties, and store them under the correct directory. Reference Vercel Blob best practices for large files and resumable uploads.

## 5. Implement File Retrieval Server Action [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Create a server action to retrieve documents from Vercel Blob based on user ID and year.
### Details:
Fetch files using the defined directory structure and return appropriate responses for valid and invalid requests.

## 6. Implement File Deletion Server Action [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Develop a server action to delete documents from Vercel Blob, ensuring only authorized deletions based on user ID and year.
### Details:
Use '@vercel/blob' to remove files, validating the request and ensuring the file exists before deletion.

## 7. Design Extensible API Interfaces for Future Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4, 1.5, 1.6
### Description: Structure server actions and APIs to allow easy integration with authentication and metadata storage in the future.
### Details:
Abstract file operations and ensure APIs can be extended to include authentication checks and metadata handling.

## 8. Document Usage and Best Practices [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation covering setup, usage, API endpoints, and best practices for large file handling, resumable uploads, and concurrency.
### Details:
Reference Vercel Blob documentation and include project-specific instructions for developers.
